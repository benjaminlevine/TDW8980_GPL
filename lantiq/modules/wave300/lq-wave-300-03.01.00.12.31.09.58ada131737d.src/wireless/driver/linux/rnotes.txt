  bug#805 fixed - Renamed "NonProc_Used_Key" to "WepTxKeyIdx" (Ran's request)

Version - 02.03.00.Intg1_(1.4.2), 2007-05-21
- Bug#786 fixed: regression - WEP configuration from wpa_supplicant
  caused kernel panic. Introduced in 1.4.0.
- Bug#781 fixed: TXMM/ADDBA deadlock in Windows driver.

Version - 02.03.00.Intg1_(1.4.1), 2007-05-19
- netif carrier disabled on connection loss (when debug mode is disabled)
- Added filtering of forwarded broadcast/multicast packets on STA that
  was initially sent by hosts behind that STA.
- Bug#777 fixed: regression in connected STAs database management.
  Find was not working well when several STAs were connected that caused
  kernel panic. Introduced in WDS support in 1.4.0 version.

Version - 02.03.00.Intg1_(1.4.0), 2007-05-15
- Packet capture support added to Debug API.
- Multiple cards support added. Use ENABLE_MULTI_CARD to enable
- WDS full support added
- SIOCGIWENCODEEXT ioctl implemented for security on AP. hostapd uses this
  ioctl to get currect Tx group RSC that is needed for 4-Way Handshake with
  newly connected station.
- Bugfix for SnapGear w/ Linux-2.6: use kernel's WE version if it is greater
  then 18 in ioctl_getrange(). The bug caused the failure in getting scan
  results by wpa_supplicant.
- Bug#705 fixed - MaxTxPower and updated A,B params for TPC calibration
- Bug#662 fixed - MaxPower should be frequency dependant
- /proc/.../MaxTxPower removed - read from EEPROM along w/ TPC from now.
- 11i on AP bugfix - hostapd was not informed about STA disconnect.
- Bug#751 fixed - "UMI_RSN_IE_MAX_LEN is pretty short to handle WPA+WPA2 case
  on AP".

Version - 02.02.00.Intg1_(1.3.0), 2007-05-07
- Bug#720 fixed - ESSID size
- Bug#633 fixed - Video and Voice was configured wrong in CLI
- Bug#737 fixed - replay counter initialized to zero on Tx that is wrong
  (should be initialized to 1)
- Bugfix for security on AP: initial group key was not set on AP and thus
  initial ping from AP was not working (relates to bug#698?)
- Bug#735 fixed - application wasn't able to get long ESSID (32 characters)
  with SIOCGIWESSID ioctl
- SIOCSIWESSID handler is compatible with WE21 from now. See
  http://lwn.net/Articles/202838 for details.
- Counter for number of received replayed packets added.
- From now default channel is zero and ESSID is empty, so automatic card
  activation on ifconfig will be possible if these both are configured
  explicitly by user.
- Feature#740 - filter only 802.1X packets before keys are set in secure
  associations. This prevents accident sending unencrypted packets to air.

Version - 02.02.00.Intg1_(1.2.0), 2007-04-27
- Added initial supprt for WDS: support of 4-address RX/TX
- Ability to work with WEP using supplicant was added
- 802.11i support for AP was added
- Bug#701 fixed - understand 0x prefix in /proc/.../WepKeys
- Additional fix to bug#615 - reconnect was still started when connecting
  using /proc/.../connect

Version - 02.02.00.Intg1_(1.1.2), 2007-04-25
- Bug#695 fixed - supplicant is not notified when STA initiates disconnect
- Bug#643 (#693) fixed - Security in Scan Results displayed as "Unknown"
- Bug#662 fixed - MaxTxPower read out of the EEPROM - now is frequency (channel)
  dependent
- Bug#617 fixed - aggregation was not closed on STA disconnect
- Bug#703 fixed - ADDBA will not be sent on non-N STAs or APs

  fragmented MSDUs.

  different HW types automatically
- Bug#623 fixed - Aggregation size was not changed in CLI
- Bug#673 fixed - added RX/TX counters for each QoS AC
- Bug#672 fixed - received packets counter was incremented on NULL packets

Version - 02.02.00.Intg1_(1.1.0), 2007-04-17
  WARNING! This version requires special support from MAC (see Feature#610).
- Feature#610 implemented. From now MSDU fragments number and MIC failures
  notifications are passed from MAC to driver in UMI_DATA message. MSDU
  fragments number is needed to perform Replay Detection correctly for
  fragmented MSDUs. MIC failures notification flag is passed to driver because
  MIC failures has to be alarmed after Replay Detection (which is performed by
  driver).
- Bug#611 fixed - reconnect with supplicant and WPA/WPA2 was not working:
  new reconnection was interpreted as secure one before 4-Way handshake.
- Bug#622 fixed - Dongle stuck when scan is failed.
- Bug#634 fixed - GTK (Group Transient Key) was not get properly from supplicant
  and as result incorrect GTK was set to MAC.
- Bug#515: TPC read from the EEPROM
- Bug#515: MAC-address read from the EEPROM (could be overridden via
  /proc/.../MAC)
  Note! Beware of no address is set through /proc and EEPROM has no valid
  MAC address (there is no EEPROM validity checks defined by EEPROM spec).

Version - 02.02.00.Intg1_(1.0.3), 2007-04-11
- Bug#614 fixed - kernel panic with wpa_supplicant.
- Bug#615 fixed - reconnect is OFF now.

  to ASSERT FAIL (bug #576)

  appropriate macro defined. Uninterruptible behavior could lead
  to driver hang during init phase.
- sendman_blocked_wait could be interrupted if timed-out
  Uninterruptible behavior could lead to driver hang during
  activate phase and data exchange with BCL server.

  removed: bug was fixed in MAC.
- Gen2 parameters updated, odd parameters removed.

Version - 0.4.0.385, 2006-12-19
- Long initial ping time issue was fixed. Broadcast packets were
  reordered that is not correct.
- Reordering change that fixed the "STA disconnects from AP during
  receiving traffic (overnight test failure)" issue. Before this change
  if reordering is slower then the rate of received packets, then
  new packets are just pushed up to OS's stack - this is not correct
  approach. In such situation we have to purge reordering queue.
- Workaround for gen2 connection establishing "unknown message" issue.

Version - 0.4.0.344, 2006-12-12
- RateSelection paremeter is not relevant for Gen2 - removed.

Version - 0.4.alpha3, 2006-11-29
- AP forwarding feature finished.
- When Reliable Multicast is enabled IGMP Reports will neither be
  forwarded nor transmitted to STAs that do not send IGMP Queries
- rx_timestamp of STA updated on each received by AP packet (not only
  NULL data packets); STA sends NULL packets only in case of data
  trafiic absence

  OpenPC Linux 2.6)

- Auto Reconnect feature was added.
- Auto Aggregate feature was added.
- AP forwarding feature was added (not working yet).
- Ability to change MAC address of wlan0 interface for the OS by ifconfig
  to support MAC Cloning was added. Note: the changed new MAC address will
  not be propagated to WiFi MAC address that is in /proc/sys/dev/mtlk/MAC .
- Reordering on AP in bridge mode was not working.

Version - 0.3.1, 2006-11-24

- MAC versions is printed in /proc/.../version along with driver version.
- Crash bug on driver module reloading was fixed.
